## Future work

Some ideas for future improvements or features ðŸ¤“ 

* Improve tests
  * Measure test coverage
  * Add tests that cover import of the resource
  * Add tests that check behavior when the engine_path or iam username is changed
* add support also for other cloud secret backends (gcp, azure, alicloud, ...)
